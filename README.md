# Feilong Client scripts and tools

## Introduction
To better help me with the development of new
functionality for the z/VM Cloud Connector (Feilong)
I shall use this repository to create some tools to
test and prototype the new functionality

## Background
My internship company has asked me to develop some
functionality within Feilong so we can deploy Linux
guests in z/VM that are able to boot from direct SCSI
disks. Even though I will eventually be doing most of
the work in a fork of the real project that can be found
[here](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/python-zvm-sdk).

This repo will contain my test scripts and some tooling.
